Overview
The Prisma Schema (or schema for short) is the main method of configuration for your Prisma ORM setup. It consists of the following parts:

Data sources: Specify the details of the data sources Prisma ORM should connect to (e.g. a PostgreSQL database)
Generators: Specifies what clients should be generated based on the data model (e.g. Prisma Client)
Data model definition: Specifies your application models (the shape of the data per data source) and their relations
It is typically a single file called schema.prisma (or multiple files with .prisma file extension) that is stored in a defined but customizable location.

note
Looking to split your schema into multiple files? Multi-file Prisma Schema is supported via the prismaSchemaFolder preview feature in Prisma ORM 5.15.0 and later.

See the Prisma schema API reference for detailed information about each section of the schema.

Whenever a prisma command is invoked, the CLI typically reads some information from the schema, e.g.:

prisma generate: Reads all above mentioned information from the Prisma schema to generate the correct data source client code (e.g. Prisma Client).
prisma migrate dev: Reads the data sources and data model definition to create a new migration.
You can also use environment variables inside the schema to provide configuration options when a CLI command is invoked.
